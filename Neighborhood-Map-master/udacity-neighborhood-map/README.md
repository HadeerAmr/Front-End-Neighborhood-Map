# Neighborhood Map Project 

> Developed for Project 5-1 of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**. 

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 

Included is a list of my and my friends' favorite restaurants and hangouts in the South San Francisco Bay Area of California.  

There's also with some local parks in the area.  

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. 

There's also extra info pulled from Foursquare where available. This includes websites and phone numbers. 

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries. 

It can also recalibrate itself based on your screen size. Try resizing the window!  

# How To Use

1. open index.html to open website
2. Click on any of the places on the map / sidebar for more information
3. Type in the white bar if you only want to see a few of the places listed on the map to make it easier to spot.
